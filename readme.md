## Hi! This is my repository containing all the tests questions & solutions for Python Unittest Library!

They were created based on this [Unittest Framework Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unit-testing-python-unittest-framework/) at Udemy.

### Basically the format is divided into files and their subjects:

    0. Usage of assert
    1. Basic principles of unit framework
    2. Assertion
    3. Skipping Tests
    4. Test Fixtures
    5. Tests in Functions
    6. Tests in Classes
    7. Usage of Parameters
    8. Mocking
    9. Sample testing into real projects
    10. Concepts of TDD
    
e.g.:
`test_unittest_5_functions.py` this file, number **5** will contain all the questions of testing functions.
